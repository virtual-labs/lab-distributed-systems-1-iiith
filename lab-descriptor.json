This lab focuses on the critical challenges of global time synchronization, event ordering via logical clocks, and parallel processing paradigms. Through interactive experiments, students implement MapReduce for heavy computations and explore essential coordination algorithms like Mutual Exclusion and Minimum Spanning Trees, bridging the gap between theoretical models and practical system design.",
